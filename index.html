            <p>My name is Joseph Magdaleno. I am currently Twenty three years old and attend UCSD coding bootcamp. Coding has been something I have always wanted to do but never found college courses to be very informative when it came to this topic. Using some research and asking peers I found out about the UCSD extension they had. This course has allowed me to take the code by the keyboard and finally learn what ive always wanted to.</p>

            <p>Many things that keep me interested in coding is the endless possibilites you have to explore your creativity. The amount of effort you put into your code will show on the finished product!
              I currently have 2 months of coding experience. Go to my portfolio page to see some of the work I have done so far.
